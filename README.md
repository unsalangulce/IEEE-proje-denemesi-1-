# IEEE-proje-denemesi
Single-Cell Data UMAP Viewer in Shiny for Python
# Overview
# The goal of this project is to build an interactive web application using Shiny for Python to visualize single-cell RNA-seq data stored in .h5ad format.
 Upload a .zip file containing an .h5ad file.
 Unzip the file and process its contents.
 Load the .h5ad file and generate a UMAP plot for the data.
 Develop the project in a modular and organized way, following good coding practices.
 
# Aim of the Project
This project aims to develop an interactive web application that visualizes single-cell RNA-seq data using Shiny for Python. Within the scope of the project:
Users will be allowed to upload data in .h5ad format in a .zip file.
The ZIP file will be opened and the .h5ad file inside will be processed.
UMAP visualization will be created.
The code will be written in a modular and orderly manner.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x (Preferably 3.7+)
data in .h5ad format in a .zip file
Required Libraries:
shiny
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib

pip install shiny pandas seaborn matplotlib
