Single-Cell Data UMAP Viewer in Shiny for Python

# The goal of this project is to build an interactive web application using Shiny for Python to visualize single-cell RNA-seq data stored in .h5ad format.
 Upload a .zip file containing an .h5ad file.
 Unzip the file and process its contents.
 Load the .h5ad file and generate a UMAP plot for the data.
 Develop the project in a modular and organized way, following good coding practices.
 Document at least five errors/bugs encountered, explain their resolution, and share
error screenshots.
# Scope of the Project
This project allows students to:
. Understand the basics of web app development with Shiny for Python.
. Learn how to handle file uploads and process uploaded files dynamically.
3. Gain experience working with scanpy for single-cell analysis.
. Implement UMAP visualization for dimensionality reduction.
5. Develop debugging and problem-solving skills by analyzing and resolving coding errors.
